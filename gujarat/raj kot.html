<h2>Rani Ki Vav,Rajkot Overview

<br>
Rani Ki Vav or 'Queen's Stepwell' is a distinctive form of water storage system located in the small town of Gujarat called Patan, on the banks of River Saraswati. Believed to be the grandest stepwell in the state of Gujarat, Rani ka Vav epitomises the peak of Maru-Gujarat architectural style. The 900-year-old structure listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site is displayed prominently in the new ₹ 100 currency note issued by the Reserve Bank of India.
  <br><br>
  In the olden days, the water of the well had medicinal properties which helped ward off diseases like viral diseases and fever. The well was excavated in the 1960s in a well-protected state as it was buried under slit for sanctuaries. In addition to this, Rani Ka Vav was an important centre for socializing among the locals as well as taking refuge from the heat. It's an excellent example of turning something functional into a piece of art.

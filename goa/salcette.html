  <br><h2> Dudhsagar Falls, Salcette Overview</h2><br>
  One of India's tallest waterfalls, the Dudhsagar Falls is located inside the Mollem National Park. The majestic falls are a little farther inland approximately 60 km from Panaji on the Goa - Karnataka Border. Literally translating to Sea of Milk , the 310 m high waterfall is divided into four tiers on the Mandovi river and resemble a heavy rush of milk flowing effortlessly down the hill. While most people arrive at the Dudhsagar falls by jeep or by their own private transport from Panaji and nearby areas, others choose to visit the falls through a train journey or by trekking. The famous Dudhsagar Railway trek is closed to the public but the trek to the lower falls is still open.The Dudhsagar falls should be visited during the monsoon when it is in full flow and the surrounding deciduous forests are at their verdant best. However, reaching the falls during monsoon if difficult and it is closed if the water level gets too high.

  <h2> Basilica of Bom Jesus, Salcette Overview</h2><br>
  The Basilica of Bom Jesus Church located in Goa is one of a kind in India and is known for its exemplary baroque architecture. Built in 1594 and consecrated in 1605, the building of this church coincides with the beginning of Christianity in India. The church is located in Old Goa in Bainguinim about 10 km away from Panjim. The oldest church in Goa, it holds the remains of St. Francis Xavier, a special friend of St. Ignatius Loyola with whom he founded the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). Even after 400 years, the remains are in good condition and are taken out once every decade. 
  <br><br>
  A site with rich cultural and religious significance, the Basilica of Bom Jesus has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Literally translating to 'Holy Jesus', this is the only church in Old Goa that is not been plastered on the outside. The facade of the church has triangular roofing which is delicately carved with the initials 'IHS', which is an abbreviation for Jesuit emblem meaning 'Jesus, Saviour of Men'. Inside, the floor of the Basilica is made of marble mosaic with precious stones, giving it a solemn appearance. The interior is embellished with a screen that runs from the floor to the ceiling and has the image of St. Ignatius Loyola protecting an infant Jesus. Above all is the image of the Holy Trinity, which is the most sacred symbol in Christianity. The Basilica of Bom Jesus is over 408 years old and is open to the public every day.

   <h2>Butterfly Beach, Salcette Overview</h2><br>
   A little to the south of Palolem in Cancona region of Goa lies the Butterfly Beach. This beach, also known as Honeymoon Beach, is in the form of a small cove surrounded by dense trees. One of the most secluded and lesser-known beach of Goa, the butterfly beach is mostly accessible by a boat (ferry) ride from the nearby beaches, which only adds to the charm.Enclosed by a thick forest on one side and leading to the open sea on the other, the beach has a unique and picturesque landscape. Butterfly Beach is also one of the few places in Goa to sight the playful dolphins. Avoid visiting the beach during the monsoon as the boat rides are mostly unavailable during heavy rainfall.\
<br><br>
Vehicles do not lead directly to Butterfly Beach and reaching here through land involves a challenging forest hike. However, this also makes for a wonderful opportunity to go trekking through a forest! Interestingly, Butterfly Beach is so named as the surrounding trees attract a wide variety of butterflies occasionally. It may also be because the beach itself is in the shape of a butterfly! Either way, it is just as pretty as one, especially during sunsets.

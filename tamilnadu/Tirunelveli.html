    <h2>Courtallam Falls Overview
    </h2>
    Set in the midst of a Panchayat town in the Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu, the Courtallam falls are renowned in the state for its enormity as well as ferocity. At an elevation of 160 metres (520 feet), the cascade towers above its green surroundings and magnificent hillside. A scene from the award-winning 1992 Hindi movie 'Roja' was filmed here, along with several other South Indian movies, and the waterfall has continued to grow in its popularity as a tourist attraction since then. Various facilities have been set up in the area for catering to travellers, including food stalls and commercial merchandise distinctive to the region. 
    </p>
    The Courtallam Falls are a natural collection of small waterfalls that ultimately end up together at the base as a single, gigantic cascade. They are said to descend from several major rivers originating in the mountainous such as Chittar, Pachaiyar, and Maninuthar Rivers among many others. It is a common belief among the local folklore that the waters of Courtallam have medicinal properties that could cure a disability. The rocks behind the falls have been eroded to form uniquely shaped, honeycomb-like structures. There are also some Shivalingas (small idols of Lord Shiva) that can be found to be carved among the rocks in the locale.

The raids and wars, particularly between Muslim Sultans who controlled Madurai and Hindu kings who controlled Thanjavur caused damage.These were repaired by Hindu dynasties that regained control.The sanctum is at the center of the western square. It is surrounded by massive walls that are divided into levels by sharply cut sculptures and pilasters providing deep bays and recesses. Each side of the sanctuary has a bay with iconography. The interior of the sanctum sanctorum hosts an image of the primary deity, Shiva, in the form of a huge stone linga. It is called Karuvarai, a Tamil word that means "womb chamber".

Ram Setu, also known as Adam's Bridge, is considered as a legendary bridge which is mainly a chain of coral reefs and sandbanks. This mythical bridge has a lot of controversies associated regarding its origin and structure. The place offers a very relaxed aura and is a blissful experience for the travellers.

    Dhanushkodi is the last tip of Rameshwar Island, and the Ram Setu Point is located a few meters away from Dhanushkodi. Adam's Bridge is an age-old structure which is believed to be around 1.7 million years old. The earliest mention of this bridge can be found in the Indian Sanskrit epic Ramayana, written by Valmiki. It was built by the Vanara army of Rama and was used to rescue Sita from Ravana. The stones used to make this bridge was adorned by the name of Lord Rama and were hence believed to float in water</p>

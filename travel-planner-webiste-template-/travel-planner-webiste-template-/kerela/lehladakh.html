    <h2>Nubra Valley, LADAKH Overview
    </h2>
    <br>
    Nubra Valley lies in the union territory of Ladakh at a distance of around 140 Km from Leh. Located on the ancient Silk Route, the valley has Shyok and Nubra rivers snaking through it and some beautiful monasteries. <br>
    With arid mountains in the backdrop, Hundar in Nubra Valley is famous for the Bactrian camel rides. Bactrian camels are of the rarest sort, having two humps and were the primary source of transportation in the silk route. Diskit Monastery in Nubra Valley is known for the 32 metre Maitreya Buddha statue located near the monastery. There are a lot of activities like ATV rides and ziplining in the Nubra Valley. <br>
    The region is currently under military supervision because the road further leads to the Siachen base camp, which happens to be the highest battlefield in the world. Most tourists travel to Nubra Valley from Leh through Khardung La.

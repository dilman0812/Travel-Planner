  <h2> Sonamarg, KASHMIR Overview</h2><br>
  Sonamarg is a picturesque hill station in Jammu and Kashmir, located 80km north-east of Srinagar. At an elevation of around 2,730 metres above sea level, Sonamarg is known for its snow-laden fields, surrounded by majestic glaciers and serene lakes which casts subtle spells on the travellers. <br>
  The hill is enveloped by the great Himalayan glaciers - Kolhoi Glacier and Machoi Glacier - and gives rise to the famous Three Sisters of Kashmir Valley. Towering over this charming hill town are the peaks like Kolhoi Peak, Amarnath Peak, Machoi Peak and Sirbal Peak which makes Songamarg a popular place for adventure sports tourism. <br>
  Sonamarg acts as the base camp for the trekking routes which leads to the mountain lakes such as Gangabal, Vishansar, Gadsar, Satsar and Kishansar. The Valley is divided into two halves by the Thajiwas range - on one side is the fir-covered Thajiwas spur popular for its camping site. The other side houses some stunning waterfalls and the Thajiwas glacier which is the prime attraction of this place. <br>
  Sonamarg remains inaccessible during winters as the NH1D connecting it to the nearby places closed down due to heavy snowfall and avalanches.

   <h2> Thottada Beach Overview</h2><br>
   Between the coastal towns of Kannur and Thalassery along the Malabar Coast lies the scenic Thottada Beach. Ideal for sunbathers and those looking to unwind by the beach, this virgin beach remains one of the cleaner beaches of the coast due to being relatively unexplored as compared to the other beaches of the coast that receive more publicity. The cleanliness, solitude and tranquillity are part of the charm of the beach, making it the ideal getaway for anyone looking to escape the noise of the city and reconnect with nature and themselves.<br><br>

   The serene vibe of the beach complements the lovely natural elements that form this alluring atmosphere. The clear blue waters of the Arabian Sea crash onto the shimmering golden sheets of sand across this 800-metre stretch, with gorgeous coconut palms towering over the rocks of the shore, coloured between the spectrum of red and black. This beach is also the site where the Thottada river meets the Arabian Sea. Near the beach, the river forms swamp-like areas where one can find some interesting natural diversity. A number of guest houses and beach houses fringe this quiet beach, where one can admire the natural beauty of the coast at its best.

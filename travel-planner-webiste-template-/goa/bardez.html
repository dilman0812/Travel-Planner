  <h2>Fort Aguada, Bardez Overview
  </h2>
  <br>
  Fort Aguada is a 17th-century Portuguese fort looking out at the confluence of Mandovi River and the Arabian Sea. The
  crumbling ramparts of the fort stand on the Sinquerim Beach, approximately 18 km from Panjim. The highlight of the
  fort is a lone four-storey lighthouse (which is one-of-its-kind in Asia )and a stunning view of the sunset.
  <br><br>
  Built-in 1612 as a protection from Dutch and Marathas, Fort Aguada was the most prized and crucial fort for the
  Portuguese and covers the entire peninsula at the southwestern tip of Bardez. The fort is so named after the
  Portuguese Word for water i.e. 'Agua' and used to be a replenishing source of freshwater for sailors. In fact, it has
  the capacity to hold 2,376,000 gallons of water and was one of the biggest freshwater reservoirs of Asia. Fort Aguada
  has also been used as Aguada jail. A statue in front of the jail salutes the freedom fighters, giving the fort a touch
  of patriotism.

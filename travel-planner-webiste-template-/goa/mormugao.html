  <h2> Chapora Fort,Mormugao Overview</h2><br>
  Chapora Fort, located 10 km away from Mapusa, is undeniably one of the most famous forts in Goa. Built by the Portuguese in 1717, Chapora Fort has a long and fascinating history attached to it. More popularly known as the 'Dil Chahta Hai Fort', its claim to fame was the 2001 Bollywood blockbuster shot here. A scintillating escape, it offers beautiful views of the sea and Chapora River.Chapora Fort has passed through the possession of numerous rulers over a long period of time, right from the Portuguese to the Marathas and the ruins tell a story of their own! You can still see the entry points of the two tunnels that were built by the Portuguese to use as an escape in times of emergency.
  <br><br>
  The fortifications around the current location of Chapora Fort existed long before the Portuguese even landed in Goa. It was originally built by Muslim ruler Adil Shah and was called Shahpura. The fort was later reconstructed by the Portuguese who named it Chapora, after the Chapora River that flows right alongside it. The highlight of the fort is the breathtaking view of the adjoining Vagator beach overlooking the Arabian Sea, especially at sunset. However, reaching the top of the now-ruined fort requires a steep 10-minute climb.

    <h2>Divar Island, Mormugao Overview
    </h2>
    <br>
    Located at a distance of 10 km from Panjim in Goa, Divar Island is a slice of heaven tucked away in dense woods amidst the beauty of nature. Connected to Old Goa only through ferry service, this island is synonymous with natural beauty, serenity and tranquillity. Commonly recognised as a ‘village stuck in time’; the area is still unexplored and unexploited by tourism or commercialisation as it is disconnected from city life.
    <br><br>
    Divar Island is dotted with vintage houses built in Portuguese style, littered with traditional churches and is surrounded by evergreen paddy fields. Unlike the loud and hippie party culture of Goa, this place provides the contrasting peace and environment to the wanderers to make them want just to explore it. The term ‘divar’ is derived from the word ‘dipavati’, which means ‘small island’ in Konkani. The term is pronounced as ‘divaddi’. Although Divar Island hardly has any particular sightseeing spots, the innate beauty and charm of the narrow winding roads, the tiny tea stalls and overall aura will make you want never to leave the island.

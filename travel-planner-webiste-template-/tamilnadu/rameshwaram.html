    <h2> Thiruppullani Overview</h2><br>
    Thiruppullani is an ancient temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu but the presiding deity is Lord Darbha Sayana Rama whose idol is seen in a reclining posture. A good example of Dravidian architecture, the complex was built when Chola Kingdom was in power. It is one of the 108 Divya Desams - a pilgrimage visited most during the Rameshwaram pilgrimage.The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. Like other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed six times a day: Ushathkalam at 7 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 7:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 10:00 p.m. The Vaikhanasa Agama Shastrams and Thengalai Vaishnava traditions are followed in all the temple rituals. 
    <br><br>
    The temple is believed to have been initiated during the Medieval Chola period along with many temples dedicated to Rama. The Chola king Parantaka I named himself "Sangrama Raghava" after his conquest of Sri Lanka, while his son Aditya I was called Kothandarama. Some later Pandya kings also made contributions to the temple.[1] A mutilated inscription in the temple made during the 37th year of Maravarman Sundara Pandyan in 1305 records order of a minister by name Arya Chakravarthi.

    <h2>Ram Setu Overview</h2><br>
    Ram Setu a natural bridge that connects India with its neighbouring country Sri Lanka, is set amidst a gorgeous setting of raw nature that can leave anyone awe inspired by its beauty. The 50 kilometres long and 3-kilometre wide bridge starts as a chain of shoals from Dhanushkodi (tip of India's Pamban Bridge) and ends at Sri Lanka's Mannar Island. Ram Setu, also known as Adam's Bridge, is considered as a legendary bridge which is mainly a chain of coral reefs and sandbanks. This mythical bridge has a lot of controversies associated regarding its origin and structure. The place offers a very relaxed aura and is a blissful experience for the travellers.
    <br>
    Dhanushkodi is the last tip of Rameshwar Island, and the Ram Setu Point is located a few meters away from Dhanushkodi. Adam's Bridge is an age-old structure which is believed to be around 1.7 million years old. The earliest mention of this bridge can be found in the Indian Sanskrit epic Ramayana, written by Valmiki. It was built by the Vanara army of Rama and was used to rescue Sita from Ravana. The stones used to make this bridge was adorned by the name of Lord Rama and were hence believed to float in water</p>

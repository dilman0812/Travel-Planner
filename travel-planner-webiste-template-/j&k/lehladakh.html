    <h2>Nubra Valley, LADAKH Overview
    </h2>
    <br>
    Nubra Valley lies in the union territory of Ladakh at a distance of around 140 Km from Leh. Located on the ancient Silk Route, the valley has Shyok and Nubra rivers snaking through it and some beautiful monasteries. <br>
    With arid mountains in the backdrop, Hundar in Nubra Valley is famous for the Bactrian camel rides. Bactrian camels are of the rarest sort, having two humps and were the primary source of transportation in the silk route. Diskit Monastery in Nubra Valley is known for the 32 metre Maitreya Buddha statue located near the monastery. There are a lot of activities like ATV rides and ziplining in the Nubra Valley. <br>
    The region is currently under military supervision because the road further leads to the Siachen base camp, which happens to be the highest battlefield in the world. Most tourists travel to Nubra Valley from Leh through Khardung La.

   <h2>Leh, LADAKH Overview</h2><br>
   Popularly known as a biker's paradise, Leh is one of the two capitals of Ladakh that has numerous passes linking various locations in the challenging terrain. The city is nestled in a valley at an elevation of around 3,520 m in the upper Indus River, enveloped by the colossal peaks of the Ladakh Range. Regardless of its harsh weather and difficult accessibility, Leh was once an essential stopover for vital trade routes that connected Tibet to the East, Kashmir to the West and India to China. Today, Leh is the best Himalayan town to find untouched natural beauty. <br>
   Most of the towns around Leh are said to have been founded by Nyima Gon. Many historical events led to the formation of today's Leh, and the city captures its past through various exquisitely built monuments, palaces, mosques, monasteries, etc. Leh is famous for its high altitudes and has so much to offer, not only to young solo travelers & bikers but also to families and couples.
